                <p>Shopping for groceries can get quite expensive these days, 
                    as such our team wants to build a mobile application that 
                    helps users compare the prices of items they want to buy in 
                    nearby supermarkets, this can prevent many spontaneous 
                    decisions that added up would become costly. Food waste is 
                    also a problem our team seeks to reduce, as it was money not 
                    well spent and may encourage restocking. We want to solve this 
                    problem by tracking when groceries bought by the user expire, 
                    sending the user a notification when a product is near its 
                    expiration date.</p>
