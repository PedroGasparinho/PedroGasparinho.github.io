        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>During the time we will be developing our project, 
            the focus of our team will be to solve the issue 
            of choosing the best way to save money while doing 
            the groceries by giving the client the necessary 
            information to choose which supermarket has the 
            best prices for each of the products of their list. 
            We also thought that our app would be more complete 
            if it also had the ability to track the expiration 
            date of certain products and give our client the 
            notifications not only to reduce food waste but to 
            also help them know if they need to restock that 
            product in the near future. If we had time, we also 
            wanted to implement another functionality that would 
            transfer the list our client made for a specific store 
            in our app to their designated website so our client 
            could make an easy purchase online without having 
            to do the same list twice.</p>
